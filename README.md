# Corizo-Major-Project-AI
## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction <br>
Implemented various ml models like Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict cardiovascular disease among people using the given dataset and comparing their accuracy level. I also implemented correlation matrix for finding relation among different parameters and used heatmaps for getting better insights of the accuracy level of different models. <br>
